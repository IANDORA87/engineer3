## Motor_control


### Description & Code Snippets

  * The goal of the assignment was to control motor with the speeding button. 
  * I accomplish to my goal by using goal and ask firend for help and using my idea also I take a step by step top accomplish to my goial.
  * motors can draw a lot more juice (current) than LEDs.  In fact, they draw so much current, we don't want to power them directly from the Arduino.  That might fry the Arduino.  So, we will power our motor directly from a 6 V battery pack.

### Reflection


  * It is very helpful to using something like Motor because it can go forward and backward when I was use the Motor it was fun for me because it is going forward and backward but it is more when you are using the Motor on your projects. whenever I have projcet I use      motor control or tt motor. However the motor control is something to use in your project. It was little hard to find the wiring but the code was easy to find for motor control it was very short code for motor control.

### Reflection


  * The Hanger was easy to build and design it was fun to because I whited too long for this type of assinmnets. It is very fun to get use to onshape and design something nice. In this assignment thanks to the teacher because the teacher help us with some of the details to make this assingment easily for us. In this assignment you can help with friend and classmade.

### Reflection



 * This is assignment  I have to work on the  Designing Swing Arm I work on it for 3 hours to do it. To make everything I use a lot of new tools because it makeing easy for me and  i don't have to use line tool there are other tool that make mach easy  and yeah this is everything i did in this assignment just make the Designing the swing arm. This assignment was kind of easily for me to do because my first reason is that you just copy and it show you what to do. My next reason is that you don't have build same thing for different size you can just use the configurations tool to help you with it. In this assignment it will be very easily if you use the tool call configurations it is very helpful. It can help you with a lot different things. For example, it helps you with different size and different colors.
